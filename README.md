## Greetings user! ðŸ‘‹

<p id="first">Welcome to my read me page!</p>

<p>My name is <em>Devin K. Yuan</em> or through Github, <em>BinaryFallow/BinaryFallow</em>! I'm a sophomore of <i>San Francisco State University</i> and is learning how to code so that I can make these skills benefit into video game development and design I'm hoping that as I progress through the course I can learn a lot more and make my own video game or even create custom websites for ARGs (<em>Augmented Reality Games</em>) to connect to those said games.</p>

I'm really looking forward to what I can create!
